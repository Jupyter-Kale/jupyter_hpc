# Principles

Jupyter brings several key features to the world of computational science:
- Exploration
- Narrative
- Interactivity

While these are powerful qualities, Jupyter presently operates at the level of an individual notebook in one language.
We seek to harness the power of Jupyter to bring these qualities to full scientific workflows, which often involve many steps across a variety of languages.

## Exploration
Scientists love to explore.
But being constrained by computational resources, scientific computing tends to focus on maximizing computational efficiency, while sacrificing human involvement.
By combining the raw power of high performance computing resources with the flexibility of Jupyter



## What do I really mean?

## Jupyter
### Exploration
- Freedom to write anything
- Reusable code cells
    - Build something, modify it easily, try again, repeat. 
- Easy to develop something, then easy to paste it into a python script or continue running it directly from the notebook.

### Narrative
- Markdown, LaTeX, code all together
    - Tell the full story all in one place
    - Cohesive way to communicate complex ideas

### Interactivity
- Widgets - sliders, text input, controllers, etc.
- Allow you to interact directly with data & models
- Visualization & experimentation

## Kale
### Exploration
- Easily create workflows from the ground up. Start with one notebook and expand to two. Add some C++. etc.
### Narrative
- Rich descriptions for workflows and notebooks
- Communicate full HPC workflows 
- Provenance, reproducibility
### Interactivity
- Monitor HPC jobs as they're running
- Interactive notebooks as workflow steps
- Modular, widget interface




















# Goals:
- Execute scientific workflows from Jupyter. The workflow may encompass command line tasks, batch jobs, and notebooks (interactive and non-interactive)
- Monitor and interact with running jobs from Jupyter.
